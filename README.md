# Developer-Training-Work

As part of my away semester experience, this repository will contain
any work which I do in training for an AWS developer certification as well 
as any work done in writing a paper on the status of cloud technologies globally
with how they have impacted different areas of work and business.

## Update 1: 2/7/22: 5:05 PM

This first edit is covering the first "project" which I have done entirely
on my own outside of coursework, since most of the coursework provides code.
The lab I did on my own through expirimenting can be found at 
https://github.com/Rileyh2/Simple-S3-React-Lab

## Update 2: 3/9/22 6:59 PM

This is the second project which I have done for my own work, working
around API Gateway integration with Lambda functions. The lab can be 
found at https://github.com/Rileyh2/API-Gateway-Lambda-Lab. I'll have
to see what other labs I can do, since ultimately I'm starting to begin
exam preparation.
