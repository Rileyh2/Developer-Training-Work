# Developer-Training-Work

As part of my away semester experience, this repository will contain
any work which I do in training for an AWS developer certification as well 
as any work done in writing a paper on the status of cloud technologies globally
with how they have impacted different areas of work and business.

## Update 1: 2/7/22: 5:05 PM

This first edit is covering the first "project" which I have done entirely
on my own outside of coursework, since most of the coursework provides code.
The lab I did on my own through expirimenting can be found at
